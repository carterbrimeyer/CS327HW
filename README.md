# CS327HW
A collection of my homework from CS 327

For this class, we had ten assignments, you can view my work for each of the assignments in their respective branch. For each assignment we had about a week to complete our objectives.

======= TO RUN =======

Download the files from the branch of the assignment you want to run, and open the directory in terminal or command prompt. From here, enter the command

`make`

this will compile all of the files from the program. Then to run the actual application, enter the command

`./rlg327`

When you are done to clean up the output files, you can run the command

`make clean`

to remove them.
